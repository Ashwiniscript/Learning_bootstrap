                            <h2>Hockey</h2>
                            <p>Hockey is a family of sports in which two teams play against each other, using sticks to
                                propel a ball or puck into a goal. There are many variations of hockey, including field
                                hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, and street hockey. The most common forms involve two
                                teams of players trying to score by hitting a ball or puck into the opposing team's
                                goal. Field hockey is considered the national sport of India.
                                India has a strong history in field hockey, particularly during the "Golden Era"
                                (1928-1956) where they won six consecutive Olympic gold medals, according to Vedantu.
                                Hockey India is the governing body for field hockey in India, responsible for promoting
                                and developing the sport.

                            <p>Sandeep Singh (born 27 February 1986) is an Indian professional field hockey player from
                                Haryana and an ex-captain of the Indian national hockey team.[2] He generally features
                                as a full back and is a penalty corner specialist for the team. He has been dubbed
                                "Flicker Singh" in the media for his specialization of the drag-flick, one of the
                                fastest in the world.

                                Singh holds a DSP rank in the Haryana Police. He has been elected as MLA in 2019 from
                                Pehowa constituency in Kurukshetra, Haryana from Bharatiya Janata Party. He served as
                                the Sports Minister of Haryana and resigned from the post on 1 January 2023, after the
                                Haryana police registered a case against him for a sexual assault complaint.[3][4].</p>
