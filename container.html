            <p>Bootstrap has multiple meanings, generally relating to self-reliance and starting from a minimal base. In
                its most literal sense, a bootstrap is a loop on a boot that aids in pulling it on. Figuratively, it
                means improving one's situation or starting something (like a business) with minimal resources, relying
                primarily on one's own efforts and ingenuity. In computing, "bootstrap" refers to loading a minimal
                program to start a larger system, often the operating system. </p>
