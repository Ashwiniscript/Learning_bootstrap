                    <p>A <b>computer</b> is an electronic device that processes data according to instructions provided by
                        software programs. It takes input, processes it, stores information, and produces output.
                        Computers are used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex simulations.
                        Here's a more detailed explanation:<br>

                       <b> Core Functions:</b><br>

                        1. Input:
                        Computers receive data through input devices like keyboards, mice, and sensors.<br>
                        2. Processing:
                        The Central Processing Unit (CPU) follows instructions from software programs to manipulate and
                        process the input data.<br>
                        3. Storage:
                        Processed data can be stored on various storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or in the cloud.<br>
                        4. Output:
                        Results are presented to the user through output devices like monitors, printers, or speakers.

                    <p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to "see" and
                        interpret images and videos, mimicking human vision. It allows machines to identify and classify
                        objects, understand scenes, and make decisions based on visual data.</p>

                    <p>A mission computer is an embedded computing device that provides specialized processing
                        capabilities for vehicles like UAVs and UGVs. It's programmed with mission parameters, manages
                        flight control and other subsystems, and is crucial for situational awareness and
                        decision-making.  </p>

                    <p>The history of computers spans centuries, evolving from basic mechanical calculating devices to
                        the sophisticated electronic machines we use today. Early mechanical devices like the abacus.The digital revolution, fueled by microprocessors and the personal computer,
                        transformed computing into a ubiquitous technology. The conceptual idea behind the computer was developed in the 19th century, the first electronic computer was developed in the <b>1940s</b>. Earlycomputers used mechanical relays and vacuum tubes, which were replaced by transistors and later by integrated circuits, which led to the microprocessors we use today. </p>
