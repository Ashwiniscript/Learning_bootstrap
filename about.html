                    <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to instructions provided by
                        software programs. It takes input, processes it, stores information, and produces output.
                        Computers are used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex simulations.
                        Here's a more detailed explanation:
                        Core Functions:
                        Input:
                        Computers receive data through input devices like keyboards, mice, and sensors.
                        Processing:
                        The Central Processing Unit (CPU) follows instructions from software programs to manipulate and
                        process the input data.
                        Storage:
                        Processed data can be stored on various storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or in the cloud.
                        Output:
                        Results are presented to the user through output devices like monitors, printers, or speakers.
                        Key Characteristics:</p>

                    <p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to "see" and interpret images and videos, mimicking human vision. It involves training machines to identify, classify, and understand objects within visual data, allowing them to react and make decisions based on what they "see". This field combines techniques from image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning to achieve this understanding. </p>
